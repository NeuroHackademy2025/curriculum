    "Now that we've run a few classifications models, what more could we need to know about machine learning in neuroimaging ?\n",

    "When applying machine learning, however, equally important are (1) the model that we train to generate predictions and (2) how we assess the generalizability of our learned model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll focus on (2).\n",
    "In particular, we'll highlight the importance of appropriate cross-validation methods.\n",
    "First, we can look at a recent review {cite}`Poldrack_2020` showing common cross-validation methods in neuroimaging:\n",

    "_Panel B_ shows a histogram of associated sample sizes.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, many neuroscience researchers are not using cross-validation at all !\n",
    "We will briefly overview _why_ cross-validation is so important to achieve, as well as different strategies for cross-validation that are in use with neuroimaging data.\n",
    "We then provide examples of appropriate and inappropriate cross-validation within the `development_fmri` dataset. \n",
    "One thing to emphasize, here : best practice is always to have a separate, held-out validation set !\n",
    "This will allow us to make more meaningful statements about our learned model,\n",
    "but it requires having access to more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why cross-validate ?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's formalize the problem that cross-validation aims to solve, using notation from {cite}`Little_2017`. \n",
    "\n",
    "For $N$ observations, we can choose a variable $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ that we are trying to predict from data $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}$⁠.\n",
    "For example, we may have neuroimaging data for 155 participants, from which we are trying to predict their age group as either a child or an adult.\n",
    "\n",
    "The machine learning problem is to estimate a function $\\hat{f}_{\\{ train \\}}$ that predicts best $y$ from $X$.\n",
    "In other words, we want to minimize an error $\\mathcal{E}(y,\\hat{f}(X))$⁠.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is that we are interested in this error on new, unknown, data.\n",
    "Thus, we would like to know the expectaction of the error for $(y, X)$ drawn from their unknown distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\mathbb{E}_{(y,X)} [\\mathcal{E}(y,\\hat{f}(X))].\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From this we note two important points.\n",
    "  1. Evaluation procedures _must_ test predictions of the model on held-out data that is independent from the data used to train the model.\n",
    "  2. Cross-validation procedures that repeating the train-test split many times to vary the training set also allow use to ask a related question:\n",
    "    given _future_ data to train a machine learning method on a clinical problem, what is the error that I can expect on new data?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Forms of cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the importance of cross-validation in machine learning, many different schemes exist.\n",
    "The [scikit-learn documentation has a section](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html) just on this topic, which is worth reviewing in full.\n",
    "Here, we briefly highlight how cross-validation impacts our estimates in our example dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing cross-validation schemes in our example dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll keep working with the same `development_dataset`, though this time we'll fetch all 155 subjects.\n",
    "Again, we'll derive functional connectivity matrices for each participant, though this time we'll only consider the \"correlation\" measure."
