    "**Vectorized programming** is a strategy that helps mitigate Python's inherent speed issues when it comes to loops with large numbers of iterations. Python's loops are slow because Python is a high-level language, and the amount of work it has to do for every iteration of a loop to keep track of changes in the runtime system is very high. Low-level languages like C, the language in which Python and modules like NumPy were written, can perform loops very efficiently. Accordingly, if you can write code that forces NumPy to perform your loop operations, your speed can be significantly improved.\n",

We'll simulate the problem for 1,000,000 points that we randomly draw from a normal distribution over each dimension, and we'll randomly draw temperatures from a normal distribution as well."
